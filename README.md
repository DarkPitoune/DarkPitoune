Hi, I'm [Pitoune](https://pierre.dhebrail.com) !

I discovered programming in 2018. Since then, I've always been curious to discover new fields and new technologies. Over the course of my (albeit short) career, I've had the opportunity to carry out exciting projects in Python, Java, networking, DevOps.... Over the last few years, I've been focusing on web development, particularly on the front-end. My experience is centered on React, but I'd love to discover other technologies (take a look at my project in Astro for example!).
