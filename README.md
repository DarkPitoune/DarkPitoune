Hi, I'm [Pitoune](https://pierre.dhebrail.com) !

I discovered programming in 2018. Since then, I've always been curious to discover new fields, new technologies. Through my career, I had the opportunity to realize exciting projects in Python, Java, networking, DevOps... In the last few years, I have focused on web development, especially on the front end. My experience is centered around React, but I would like to discover other tech (check out my project in Vue.js for example!).
